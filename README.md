**[Deep Learning Foundations]**  
   - **Description**: As part of the Deep Learning 2024-2025 class - teached by G. Peeters & L. Le Folgoc - I worked on 6 Labs to implement and understand the foundations of deepl learning, over the following subjects: MLP,RNN,CNN.  

**[Hackathon on Drought Prediction]**  
   - **Description**: I enrolled in the Hackthon #5 organised by Hi! Paris. After Data Cleaning and feature engineering, we implemented a Mixture of Expert model with a Random Forest, XGBoost and a CatBoost classifiers to predict the level of groundwater for a given day and place. We achieved a F1 score of 0.55.

**[Stock Identification from Order Book]**
  - **Description** : I designed and trained a LSTM to predict which stock is being traded, based on anonymized 100-events sequences from order book. (Capital Fund Managment 2024 Data Challenge)
